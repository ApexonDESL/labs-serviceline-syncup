# 🚀 labs-serviceline-syncup
labs-serviceline-syncup is a centralized work-tracking repository where every task is represented as a GitHub Issue, and the type of work is defined explicitly using labels.

---

## Core Principle

**Labels define the type of work.**

Every issue must have **exactly one `type:*` label**.
This label answers the most important question first:

> *What kind of work is this?*

Everything else is secondary.

---

## Work Types (Type Labels)

Each issue must include **one and only one** of the following labels:

* `label:Engineering` – Feature development, bug fixes, refactors
* `label:Research` – Exploration, spikes, PoCs, evaluations
* `label:IP` – Patents, inventions, internal frameworks
* `label:RFP` – Proposals, bids, external responses
* `label:Content` – Blogs, whitepapers, documentation
* `label:Account-support` – Customer issues, escalations, enablement
* `label:Interview` – Hiring, interviews, candidate evaluations
* `label:Meeting` – Preparation, notes, action items

If an issue doesn’t clearly fit one type, it’s not ready to be created.

## How Work Is Tracked

* **One issue = one task**
* **Type is mandatory and explicit**
* Status, priority, and size are represented using additional labels
* GitHub Projects provides the execution view

This keeps reporting and reviews simple:

* Filter by `label:*` to see where time is going
* Group by type to spot imbalance or overload
* Review completed work without interpretation

---

## Issue Creation Rules

Before creating an issue, ensure:

* The task has a clear outcome
* The work type is unambiguous
* Large or vague work is split into smaller issues

Ambiguous work creates ambiguity in execution.

---

## What Belongs Here

Labs-serviceline-syncup tracks **all operational work**, including:

* Technical delivery
* Functional and business tasks
* External commitments
* Internal improvements

If work is discussed in email, chat, or meetings, it should end up here.

---

## What This Is Not

* Not a sprint planner
* Not a ticket dumping ground
* Not a replacement for design or thinking

It is a system to make **work visible, typed, and finishable**.

---

## Guiding Belief

Clarity drives execution.
Typed work exposes reality.
Finished work compounds.
